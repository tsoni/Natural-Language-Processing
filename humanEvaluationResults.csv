"Χρονική σήμανση","Stayed in the hotel for a week. Room was very clean and location good. Staff very helpful and friendly. Breakfest good but basic. Very convenient location. Will stay there again for sure.","This unpretentious but comfortable, good quality hotel is brilliantly located for manhattan visits. The beds are comfortable & the rooms clean and bigger than some in NYC! The staff are friendly and helpful, especially the door staff. We didn't eat there- but the bars look great. V busy.","This is an excellent small hotel (by New York standards) in a quiet location of Midtown within a few minutes walk of Times Square, the Theatre District, Bryant Park and Grand Central. The room we stayed in was quiet and comfortable and the staff were friendly and efficient. There was always free coffee available in the lobby and the library had internet access and real time flight info. I can't comment on the restaurant as we didn't eat in. I would however recommend the Red Flame diner just along the street, where you can eat breakfast with real New Yorkers at a reasonable cost. There's also Gregory's coffee bar opposite the diner which serves an awesome carrot and raisin pound cake.\nThis was our first visit to New York and we'll definitely be back for more.","I recently stayed in this hotel for three nights during a visit to NY. What a gem of a place. From the perfect location, only minutes from Time Square, St Patrick's Cathedral, 5th Ave, Central Park etc etc. Near subway stations so the entire island is within easy reach. The staff were welcoming and accommodating. My luggage did not arrive for 2 days so they did everything possible to help me out and contact the airlines on a regular basis. The lobby is welcoming with coffee/spiced cidar to enjoy. \nThe room was quiet and perfect. Comfy bog bed with chocolates nightly and Molton Brown bits in the bathroom. (very useful when you had zero luggage!). Lods of moveis to watch on your DVD player and a free newspaper every morning. Fantastic. \nI could not say enough good about this place. Will definitely be returning. :)","Stayed in a king suite for 11 nights and yes it costs us a bit but we were happy with the standard of room, the location and the friendliness of the staff. Our room was on the 20th floor overlooking Broadway and the madhouse of the Fairway Market. Room was quite with no noise evident from the hallway or adjoining rooms. It was great to be able to open windows when we craved fresh rather than heated air. The beds, including the fold out sofa bed, were comfortable and the rooms were cleaned well. Wi-fi access worked like a dream with only one connectivity issue on our first night and this was promptly responded to with a call from the service provider to ensure that all was well. The location close to the 72nd Street subway station is great and the complimentary umbrellas on the drizzly days were greatly appreciated. It is fabulous to have the kitchen with cooking facilities and the access to a whole range of fresh foods directly across the road at Fairway.\nThis is the second time that members of the party have stayed at the Beacon and it will certainly be our hotel of choice for future visits.","On every visit to NYC, the Hotel Beacon is the place we love to stay. So conveniently located to Central Park, Lincoln Center and great local restaurants. The rooms are lovely - beds so comfortable, a great little kitchen and new wizz bang coffee maker. The staff are so accommodating and just love walking across the street to the Fairway supermarket with every imaginable goodies to eat (if you choose not to go out for every meal!)","This is a great property in Midtown. We two different rooms different rooms during our stay. The first room was in the North tower, which was quite inconvenient. You have to go through the conference area to get to the north elevators. \nThe second room was the Andaz Suite. It was nicely appointed room, but the best part about it was the bathroom. From the foot soaking bowl to the bath products, everything about the bathroom was awesome!\nLemon poppy-seed pancakes are must haves at the restaurant. One of the best pancakes ever.","Excellent staff (they remembered our names from the moment our family walked in). Our original suite was overbooked, so we ended up in a much nicer suite (no complaints here). Extremely convenient location to Fifth Avenue shopping, restaurants, and subway system. Use the concierge, they worked magic throughout our entire stay. Regardless of whether we needed tickets, or merely a ride, the staff would go out of their way to make sure we were happy. Honestly will have trouble staying at any other hotel in the NYC area. Room service was superb. One of our family members forgot their toothbrush. We called downstairs and within 3 minutes, we had four. \nFor those who stay at this hotel, there's always a chance at a celebrity sighting. Our hotel neighbor happened to be Jamie Foxx, who was staying during his Django Unchained promotional tour.","Wonderful boutique hotel located next to Times Square. Subway is two blocks away to all of Manhattan. Numerous classic eateries within walking distance. Bathrooms are ideal with Japanese heated cleansing toilettes.","This hotel is a nice stay for NYC because the rooms are very clean, hotel is very comfortable, and it's in a great location. A few blocks from Herald Square, 34th street shopping, Madison Square Gardens, Penn Station...everything! The staff was very nice and always accommodating. The hotel also has a great view of the Empire State Building in rooms facing 6th Ave. Very cool pic to have if you get lucky!\nI was extremely satisfied with the my two night's stay and would stay again."
