This paper provides a detailed summary of our implementation of an aspect and document level sentiment analysis system using a lexicon-based approach. 
The paper starts with an introduction to the problem statement, the motivation behind our choice to investigate this topic as well as the relevant research that already exists in this domain. 
In addition, we present an overall plan of the steps one has to follow to tackle this research problem. 
Next we present a comprehensive description of all the implementation decisions we took while creating our system (a link to all our scripts and code can be found here [14]).
Then we display the results we have gotten from various experiments. Following that we present all the insights we have gained through the procedure of implementing an aspect level sentiment analysis system. 
Lastly, we offer suggestions of how our system could be further improved in the future.
